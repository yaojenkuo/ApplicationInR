This repository collects some R applications covering machine learning and visualization from me.

## 1. Drawing ROC Curves in R with ROCR Package

The highlights of this applications are:

* Size matters, we can predict whether if the diamond is expensive by using only one predictor: carat.
* How to draw a Kernal Density Curve in R.
* How to use R command to separate Training/Test sample datasets.
* How to build up a logistic regression model using glm().
* How to draw multiple ROC curves.
* How to write a Rmarkdown file.
